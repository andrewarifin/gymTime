## 3.1.3 (2018-10-12)

- Fixed `BarcodePicker.create()` resolving to the picker before the camera is accessed when camera access is enabled.
- Fixed `BarcodePicker.resumeScanning()`, `BarcodePicker.accessCamera()`, `BarcodePicker.setActiveCamera()` and `BarcodePicker.applyCameraSettings()` triggering unnecessary camera access operations when called while the camera is currently being accessed for other reasons.
- Fixed `CameraAccess.getCameras()` triggering unnecessary camera access operations when called while the camera is currently being accessed for other reasons.

## 3.1.1 (2018-08-16)

- Updated _external Scandit Engine library_ to version 5.8.2.
- Online license verification now only needs network calls on first usage of the library, subsequent loads use cached information and don't require network calls anymore. This also makes library loading faster.
- Fixed camera access sometimes failing in _Safari_ with a generic "Invalid constraint" error.

## 3.1.0 (2018-07-27)

- Updated _external Scandit Engine library_ with a fix for a rare bug that could cause the same barcode to be reported twice in the scan results.
- Improved scanning speed in "single image mode".
- Improved barcode recognition for common large barcode scenarios in "single image mode".
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.onSubmitFrame()` function to register a listener to get a `ScanResult` whenever a frame is submitted for processing, making it possible to retrieve the frame before scanning is performed.
- Added new `BarcodePicker.removeSubmitFrameListener()` and `BarcodePicker.removeSubmitFrameListeners()` functions to remove the new "submitFrame" listeners.
- Improved "single image mode" button area for easier clicking/tapping.
- Improved "single image mode" button visibility in some situations.
- Improved "single image mode" button display and resizing at different dimensions.
- Fixed "single image mode" occasionally triggering a `ScanResult` event with empty _barcodes_ and unexpected _imageData_/_imageSettings_ followed by a correctly populated `ScanResult` event when some barcodes are successfully scanned.
- Fixed missing font color information for "single image mode" button.
- Fixed incorrect typing information for `BarcodePicker.removeScanErrorListener()`.
- Fixed failure to compile TypeScript version of the library.
- Updated _adapter_ library to version 6.3.0.

## 3.0.0 (2018-07-18)

- Updated _external Scandit Engine library_ to version 5.8.1.
- Implemented a new "single image mode" for the `BarcodePicker` configured via the `singleImageMode` option on creation. This mode is meant as an alternative/fallback mode (provided by default as fallback) for a `BarcodePicker` to provide single camera pictures to be scanned. It still performs all operations locally in the browser, but trades off continuous camera stream access for (more high quality) single snapshot scanning; this results in less browser features needed for the library to work and extended browser support. In "single image mode" a specially set UI is provided which enables users to click/tap to directly take a picture with the camera (mobile/tablet) or upload a file (desktop), this picture is then scanned and the results are provided. In this mode special camera access permissions don't have to be requested.
- Implemented cache busting mechanism to ensure the _external Scandit Engine library_ JS and WASM files are refreshed and downloaded from the server when a new version of the library is released.
- Fixed very rare internal engine errors that could happen when converting between number representations (causing "Out of bounds Trunc operation" errors).
- Fixed `BarcodePicker` UI disappearing when the source element has a CSS transformation applied to it.
- Fixed incorrect behaviour due to engine location configuration causing an error when trying to load cached compiled WebAssembly code.
- Fixed rare condition where slow camera access could cause an error and stop the scanning process before it could start.
- Improved handling of camera access failures in some situations to prevent unhandled exceptions.
- Breaking change: `UnsupportedBrowserError` now has a new `data` property containing more details regarding the compatibility level of the used OS/browser in a new `BrowserCompatibility` object. The `message` property in the error object is now always the same generic message.
- Breaking change: Deprecated errors of type `SourceUnavailableError` that can happen on some older browsers when accessing the camera are now automatically mapped to the more recent type: `NotReadableError`.
- Removed previously deprecated `BarcodePicker.GUIStyle` numerical enumeration values.
- Removed previously deprecated `Camera.Type` numerical enumeration values.
- Updated _eventemitter3_ library to version 3.1.0.
- Updated _howler_ library to version 2.0.13.
- Updated _tslib_ library to version 1.9.3.

## 2.5.1 (2018-07-02)

- Updated _external Scandit Engine library_ with a fix for a rare QR code bug.
- Fixed a bug that caused the library to fail when showing video output in some browsers.

## 2.5.0 (2018-06-29)

- Updated _external Scandit Engine library_ to version 5.8.0.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.setCameraSwitcherEnabled()` function to dynamically show or hide the GUI button to switch between different cameras, plus a relative `BarcodePicker.isCameraSwitcherEnabled()` function to get the current status.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.setTorchToggleEnabled()` function to dynamically show or hide a GUI button to toggle device torch on/off, plus a relative `BarcodePicker.isTorchToggleEnabled()` function to get the current status.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.setTapToFocusEnabled()` function to dynamically enable or disable manual camera focus when clicking/tapping on the video, plus a relative `BarcodePicker.isTapToFocusEnabled()` function to get the current status.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.setPinchToZoomEnabled()` function to dynamically enable or disable camera zoom control via pinching gesture on the video, plus a relative `BarcodePicker.isPinchToZoomEnabled()` function to get the current status.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.getScanner()` function to retrieve the initialized (and possibly configured) `Scanner` object internally used by the `BarcodePicker` instance.
- Added a new `scanner` option to `BarcodePicker.create()` to pass and use an already initialized (and possibly configured) `Scanner` object on creation. Using this when needed can lead to faster component initalization thanks to the reuse of the already available _external Scandit Engine library_ in the object.
- Added a new `destroyScanner` argument (enabled by default) to the `BarcodePicker.destroy()` function, allowing to prevent `Scanner` destruction on `BarcodePicker` destruction.
- Changed `BarcodePicker.setActiveCamera()`'s `camera` argument to be optional: when not provided the default camera is selected.
- Fixed `BarcodePicker.pauseScanning()` not pausing camera input if the relative argument is passed and the `BarcodePicker` is already in a paused state.
- Fixed `BarcodePicker.accessCamera()` not re-accessing the camera when camera access was previously paused via `BarcodePicker.pauseScanning()`.
- Improved error reporting when getting/setting symbology settings for invalid symbologies.
- Documented new _Samsung Internet Browser 7+_ support

## 2.4.5 (2018-06-13)

- Fixed an important bug causing the _external Scandit Engine library_ to regularly block while making network requests on startup and regularly after scanning a barcode, this is now correctly handled in the background. Now startup times are slightly faster, online status is not required after library initialization and subsequent scans of barcodes are smoother and without interruptions (network conditions don't affect all these scenarios anymore).

## 2.4.4 (2018-06-05)

- Correctly throw `UnsupportedBrowserError` in case one of the WebAssembly-bugged _iOS_ versions is used (11.2.2/11.2.5/11.2.6).

- Fixed incorrect behaviour of some browsers causing an error when trying to load cached compiled WebAssembly code.

## 2.4.0 (2018-04-25)

- Implemented caching of compiled WebAssembly code on browsers that support this (currently only _Firefox_), this makes subsequent loads of the library much faster and don't require re-downloading WebAssembly files.
- Improved detection of missing browser / OS functionality in WebView scenarios on _Android_ devices.
- Implemented functionality to retrieve image data information whenever a frame is processed by a `BarcodePicker`.
- Added a new `imageData` property to the `ScanResult` object, containing the raw image byte data of the processed frame.
- Added a new `imageSettings` property to the `ScanResult` object, containing the image settings used to parse the image data of the processed frame.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.onProcessFrame()` function to register a listener to get a `ScanResult` whenever a frame is processed, independently from the number of recognized barcodes.
- Added new `BarcodePicker.removeProcessFrameListener()` and `BarcodePicker.removeProcessFrameListeners()` functions to remove the new "processFrame" listeners.
- Updated _adapter_ library to version 6.1.5.
- Improved CHANGELOG format.

## 2.3.0 (2018-04-12)

- Fixed and improved camera enumeration and selection in _Firefox_.

- Improved localization and scanning performance of challenging 1D codes in the center of the video frame.
- Fixed incorrect application of scanning search area settings in some edge cases.
- Implemented object fit options for `BarcodePicker` objects, to set the video feed to "cover" or "contain" and thus be resized differently inside the given origin element.
- Added a new `videoFit` option to `BarcodePicker.create()` to set video element fit type on creation.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.setVideoFit()` function to set fit type dynamically for the video element.
- Added a new `BarcodePicker.ObjectFit` enum to list the different types of object fit types available.
- Deprecated `BarcodePicker.GUIStyle` numerical enumeration values in favor of string values for optional easier JavaScript usage (ex. `BarcodePicker.GUIStyle.LASER` is now `"laser"` instead of `1`).
- Deprecated `Camera.Type` numerical enumeration values in favor of string values for optional easier JavaScript usage (ex. `Camera.Type.FRONT` is now `"front"` instead of `0`).

## 2.2.1 (2018-04-04)

- Fixed failing camera video feed recovery after unexpected camera identifier changes in _Safari_.

## 2.2.0 (2018-03-28)

- Implemented scanning speed throttling functionality to allow tradeoffs between scan performance and power usage.

- Added a new `BarcodePicker.reassignOriginElement()` function to re-assign the `BarcodePicker` to a different HTML element.
- Breaking change: `BarcodePicker.resumeScanning()` function now returns a promise resolving to the object instance instead of directly to the instance; this is due to the fact that the method might need to access the camera again.
- Removed previously deprecated `BarcodePicker.UIStyle` enum.
- Removed previously deprecated `BarcodePicker.UIStyle.SCANLINE` enum value.
- Removed previously deprecated `BarcodePicker.create()`'s `uiStyle` option.
