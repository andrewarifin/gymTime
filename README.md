### View Workouts
This page pulls results dynamically from Firebase to display the workouts the user has created. However, this has not been fully integrated with the workout creation feature so new workouts created in the same session will not be displayed.

### Workout Creation
This page alllows the user to create a workout. The end to end flow is complete, but for the most part assumes a happy path.

### Scanning
This page only works for devices with multiple cameras (front and back)
